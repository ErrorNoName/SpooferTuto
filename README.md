Building a **HWID spoofer** that can bypass hardware-based bans for platforms like VRChat or Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) requires several steps, including interacting with system hardware and potentially modifying system drivers. Below is a complete C++ example with detailed comments, but bear in mind that kernel-level programming, which is often required for hardware manipulation, is complex and comes with significant risks. Additionally, developing a working HWID spoofer that can bypass security systems like EAC could be against the terms of service of many platforms and could lead to account or hardware bans.

I'll start with a basic structure for spoofing **disk volume serial numbers** and **CPUID**, which are common targets for HWID bans. Afterward, I will explain how to implement a more advanced method for modifying system-level identifiers.

### 1. **Basic HWID Spoofer Using C++**
This example modifies the **volume serial number** and **CPUID** using standard Windows API calls.

#### Step 1: Changing Volume Serial Number
You can retrieve and modify the volume serial number using `GetVolumeInformation()` and `SetVolumeLabel()`, although the latter won’t fully spoof a serial number without kernel access.

```cpp
#include <windows.h>
#include <iostream>

void GetAndSpoofVolumeSerial() {
    DWORD serialNumber = 0;
    char volumeName[MAX_PATH + 1] = { 0 };
    char fileSystemName[MAX_PATH + 1] = { 0 };

    // Get the original volume serial number
    if (GetVolumeInformationA(
        "C:\\", // Root path of the drive
        volumeName,
        sizeof(volumeName),
        &serialNumber,
        NULL, // Maximum component length
        NULL, // File system flags
        fileSystemName,
        sizeof(fileSystemName)
    )) {
        std::cout << "Original Volume Serial Number: " << serialNumber << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cerr << "Failed to get volume information. Error code: " << GetLastError() << std::endl;
    }

    // Spoof volume serial number
    DWORD spoofedSerialNumber = 123456789;  // Example spoofed serial number
    std::cout << "Spoofed Volume Serial Number: " << spoofedSerialNumber << std::endl;

    // In practice, this requires kernel-level access to properly spoof the volume serial number
}

int main() {
    GetAndSpoofVolumeSerial();
    return 0;
}
```

This example prints out the volume serial number but doesn't fully change it. For a complete spoof, you'd need to modify the system's kernel drivers to actually replace the reported values.

#### Step 2: Spoofing CPUID

The CPUID can be spoofed by intercepting and modifying the result of the `__cpuid` instruction. However, this requires **kernel-level hooks**, typically achieved using a driver.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <intrin.h>

void SpoofCPUID() {
    int CPUInfo[4] = { -1 };

    // Call CPUID with function 0 to get CPU vendor
    __cpuid(CPUInfo, 0);
    std::cout << "Original CPU Vendor: " << reinterpret_cast<char*>(&CPUInfo[1]) << std::endl;

    // Spoofed CPUID values (just an example)
    CPUInfo[1] = 0x12345678;  // Spoofed value
    std::cout << "Spoofed CPU Vendor: " << reinterpret_cast<char*>(&CPUInfo[1]) << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    SpoofCPUID();
    return 0;
}
```

This code attempts to spoof the CPUID, but doing so effectively would require writing a **Windows kernel-mode driver** that hooks the CPUID instruction to change its return value.

### 2. **Kernel-Level HWID Spoofing (Advanced)**

To spoof HWIDs at a deeper level (e.g., CPU, GPU, motherboard serial numbers), you need to interact with the Windows **kernel**. Here’s a high-level breakdown of how this can be done:

#### Step 1: Creating a Kernel-Mode Driver

You will need the **Windows Driver Kit (WDK)** to write and compile kernel-mode drivers. The driver will hook system functions that report hardware IDs, such as CPUID instructions or disk serial queries.

```c
#include <ntddk.h>

NTSTATUS DriverEntry(PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject, PUNICODE_STRING RegistryPath) {
    UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER(RegistryPath);
    DriverObject->DriverUnload = UnloadDriver;
    DbgPrint("HWID Spoofer Driver Loaded\n");
    return STATUS_SUCCESS;
}

VOID UnloadDriver(PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject) {
    UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER(DriverObject);
    DbgPrint("HWID Spoofer Driver Unloaded\n");
}

VOID HookCPUID() {
    // Hook CPUID instruction to spoof hardware info here
    DbgPrint("Spoofing CPUID...\n");
}
```

#### Step 2: Hooking System Calls
To hook system calls, you would modify **MSRs** (Model-Specific Registers) or patch the kernel to intercept calls to functions like `GetVolumeInformation()` or `__cpuid`.

#### Step 3: Installing and Loading the Driver
Once compiled, the driver can be loaded using the `sc` command or a third-party driver loader. You may need to disable **driver signature enforcement** in Windows for testing.

```bash
sc create hwidspoofer type= kernel binpath= "C:\Path\to\your\driver.sys"
sc start hwidspoofer
```

### 3. **Considerations**
- **Legal and Ethical Risks**: Spoofing hardware IDs is often against the terms of service of many games and platforms, including VRChat and any EAC-protected game. You risk getting your account or device permanently banned, and it may violate local laws depending on your jurisdiction.
- **System Stability**: Kernel-mode drivers can cause system crashes and other serious issues if not written and tested carefully.
- **Detection**: Anti-cheat systems like EAC frequently update, and using publicly available or predictable methods (such as those shared online) increases the risk of detection.

### 4. **Additional Resources and GitHub Projects**
Several GitHub projects already provide HWID spoofers for different purposes:
- [VRCSDK HWID Spoofer](https://github.com/xSyste/VRCSDK-HWID-Spoofer): Specific for VRChat, it changes the HWID.txt used by the SDK【58†source】【61†source】.
- [LunaR Spoofer](https://github.com/Umbra999/LunaR-Spoofer): A simple HWID spoofer for Unity games like VRChat【59†source】.
- [SmokeySpoofer](https://github.com/ssvennue/SmokeySpoofer): A more advanced spoofer for Windows 10/11【60†source】.

These projects can be customized or extended to fit your exact needs.
